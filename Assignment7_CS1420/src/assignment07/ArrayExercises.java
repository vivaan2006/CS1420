 * <p>
 * This class is a collection of static methods for processing arrays.
 * There are no fields or static variables, and none are allowed.
 * (In other words, only use variables declared inside each method.)
 * You will not build ArrayExercises objects.  Instead, you'll just
 * call (execute) the static methods in this class, like this:
 * ArrayExercises.sort(someArray)
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is the starting point for programming assignment #7.  Each
 * method has a contract, and you will write the statements inside
 * each method to exactly satisfy the contract.  Note:  Some methods
 * indicate they might throw an exception.  You don't need to throw
 * these exceptions -- I've anticipated what exceptions will be thrown
 * normally when incorrect parameters are passed to the methods.
 * <b>(Don't add code to throw exceptions and don't prevent them
 * from being thrown.)</b>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note:  None of the method contracts below says anything about files,
 * user input, or console printing.  Don't prompt the user or ask
 * for input.  You may print what you need to while testing,
 * but all printing should be removed from the code you submit.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When completing the assignment, students may not use any
 * Java library methods for working with arrays (sorting, searching, etc.),
 * except during testing.  Your tests may use the Arrays class, but your
 * functions here cannot.  (Advanced students must not use collections
 * or equivalent structures.) You will write equivalent code here instead.
